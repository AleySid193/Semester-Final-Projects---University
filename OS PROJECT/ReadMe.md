# Operating System Model

This is an Operating System Model with various small applications. In this Project I have tried to show the functionalty of Operating System which include how it run multiple programs at once using different OS concepts like threads, parallelism, locks, etc.

**How to Run?**
1. Make sure you have a C intepreter in your system.
2. Run it using an IDE like Vs Code.
3. Run the main_source.cpp file to start the OS model.
